This is an Arduino Nano based hardware mixer control for use with deej project (https://github.com/omriharel/deej).

The idea is based on the Snackboard mix here (https://github.com/Snackya/Snackboard-mix).

I liked the idea of using a PCB as a clear printed panel, but used different slide potentiometers and decided to buy cheap knobs, rather than print them.

As I also have a 3D printer the final design will include a 3D printed spacer to act as a case, sandwiched between the two PCB's used for the project.

One PCB is unpopulated and will be used as a front panel, the other will be populated and carry the components. I've used a ground plane on the front face and a power plane on the rear to carry the 0V/5V signals to the pots, whilst 
the wipers are routed to the relevant Arduino ADC inputs.

A full BOM and 3D models of the pot's will be available in the project, once completed.
